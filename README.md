# blonded_checker

Script to check Frank Ocean's website and send email alerts if it is updated. 

If you want to use:
+ Check path for pickle in blonded.py and the .sh file
+ Check your gmail credentials or setup your own smtp credentials
+ Put a crontab as ``*/X * * * * FULLPATH/check_blonded.sh where X is the minute increment you want``


*Note if the change is too big then you don't get an email, hence the redundancy*
